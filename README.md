# Math Fact Fun (Technology Implementation of MIND Project)

Math Fact Fun (MFF) is a 'high-tech' (i.e., without paper and pencil) translation of work done by Brian Poncy (mailto:brian.poncy@okstate.edu) to create the [Measures and Interventions for Numeracy Development (MIND)](https://brianponcy.wixsite.com/mind). At present, MFF is being designed and evaluated as a way to (1) support assist teachers in sampling student performance across a range of declarative and procedural math facts, (2) to identify students who may benefit from additional practice and instructional support, and (3) attempt to deliver 'high-tech' (i.e., without paper and pencil) forms of evidence-based interventions for basic math facts using computer technology. This is an open-source project, created using [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is under active development. Work in the future will include the involvement of other collaborators and community partners.

## MFF Project Core Team

The MFF project currently includes a total of four scientists working across multiple universities. A short bio for each of the members is provided in the space below.

[Shawn P. Gilroy, Ph.D., NCSP BCBA-D LP](mailto:sgilroy1@lsu.edu) (Louisiana State University): Shawn Gilroy is an Assistant Professor of School Psychology and Louisiana State University. His clinical work and research focus on assessment and intervention for various developmental, learning, and behavioral issues of childhood. Shawn has developed numerous forms of technology designed to support evidence-based interventions (e.g., Augmentative and Alternative Communication for non-verbal autistic children). Shawn is the lead developer of MFF.

[Brian Poncy, Ph.D.](mailto:brian.poncy@okstate.edu) (Oklahoma State University): Brian Poncy is an Associate Professor in the College of Education at Oklahoma State University. His research focuses on academic interventions and behavioral principles of learning, specifically in the area of mathematics. His work focuses on the design, selection, implementation, and evaluation of academic interventions and single-case research designs. Brian is a content area expert for MFF and the developer of the MIND program.

[Gary Duhon, Ph.D., BCBA-D, NCSP](mailto:gary.duhon@okstate.edu) (Oklahoma State University): Gary Duhon is a Professor of School Psychology at Oklahoma State University. His teaching and research interests include intervention development, behavioral consultation, pre-referral intervention models, and applied behavior analysis. Gary is a content area expert for MFF.

[Corey Peltier, Ph.D.](mailto:coreypeltier@ou.edu) (University of Oklahoma): Corey Peltier is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational Psychology within the Special Education Program at the University of Oklahoma. His research interests include improving the mathematical outcomes for students at-risk or identified with a disability. A secondary line of research focused on the use of single-case designs to identify effective interventions. Corey is a content area expert for MFF.
